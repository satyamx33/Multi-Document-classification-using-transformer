Multi-Document Classification Using Transformer Models
Project Overview
This project implements multi-document classification using Transformer-based models such as BERT. The goal is to classify a collection of documents into predefined categories, leveraging the power of state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information across multiple documents. This is particularly useful for scenarios where documents are interrelated and need to be categorized as a group, rather than individually.

Problem Statement
Traditional document classification models usually classify a single document based on its content. However, in many real-world applications, documents come in groups (e.g., a set of news articles, legal documents, or medical records). Each document in a set might provide valuable context to the other documents, making it essential to analyze the entire collection to understand the relationships and classify them appropriately.

This project addresses the challenge of classifying a group of related documents as a cohesive unit rather than treating each document in isolation.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
transformers (Hugging Face)
PyTorch or TensorFlow (for model training)
scikit-learn (for evaluation)
pandas, numpy (for data manipulation)
matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)
datasets (for dataset handling)
Model: Pre-trained Transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT
Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of collections of documents labeled with predefined categories. You may use datasets from various domains such as:

News articles (e.g., AG News dataset)
Legal documents (e.g., court cases, rulings)
Medical documents (e.g., clinical notes)
For simplicity, this implementation assumes each instance in the dataset contains multiple related documents, where the model will learn to classify the entire set of documents as belonging to one or more categories.

Approach
1. Data Preprocessing
Tokenization: The input documents are tokenized into individual tokens using a tokenizer compatible with the Transformer model (e.g., BERT tokenizer).
Padding: Since Transformer models typically work with fixed-length inputs, sequences are padded or truncated to the maximum length (e.g., 512 tokens for BERT).
Handling Multiple Documents: Multiple documents are concatenated into one sequence for each training sample. Special tokens (like [SEP]) are used to separate documents.
2. Model Architecture
Transformer Model: Pre-trained Transformer models such as BERT or RoBERTa are fine-tuned for the classification task. These models are designed to understand contextual relationships in long text sequences and work well for multi-document inputs.
Input Representation: Multiple documents are concatenated and passed through the model. Each document within the input may be treated as a separate segment (using segment embeddings).
Classification Layer: A classification head (fully connected layer) is added on top of the Transformer model to produce the final class labels.
3. Fine-Tuning
Pre-trained models like BERT are fine-tuned on the labeled multi-document classification dataset. During fine-tuning, the model learns domain-specific features and adjusts its weights for optimal performance on the classification task.
4. Model Training
The model is trained using the cross-entropy loss function for multi-class or multi-label classification, depending on the use case.
Optimization: Adam optimizer is used to optimize the model parameters. Learning rate scheduling (e.g., linear warm-up) is implemented to improve convergence.
5. Evaluation
The model’s performance is evaluated using standard metrics:
Accuracy: The percentage of correct classifications.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: For imbalanced classes, precision and recall provide a better understanding of model performance.
Confusion Matrix: To visualize misclassifications across categories.
6. Post-Processing
The model’s output is used to classify new multi-document inputs. Each document set is assigned one or more categories based on the model's predictions.
Usage
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn datasets
Training the Model
Prepare Dataset: Format your multi-document dataset in a structure where each instance contains a collection of related documents.

Run Training Script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --model_name bert-base-uncased --epochs 5 --batch_size 16 --learning_rate 2e-5
Evaluate Model:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py --model_path saved_model/
Example:
python
Copy code
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
import torch

# Load model and tokenizer
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=3)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Sample multi-document input
documents = ["Document 1 content...", "Document 2 content...", "Document 3 content..."]
inputs = tokenizer(documents, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)

# Get model predictions
outputs = model(**inputs)
predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)

print(predictions)
Results
After training, the model should be able to classify multiple documents into categories with high accuracy. Performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices will help determine the model's effectiveness.

Challenges and Future Work
Long Document Lengths: BERT has a maximum token limit (typically 512 tokens), which can be problematic for long documents. Future work could explore techniques like chunking or long-range attention to handle longer inputs.
Multi-label Classification: For cases where documents belong to multiple categories, techniques like sigmoid activation in the classification head and binary cross-entropy loss can be used.
Domain-Specific Models: Fine-tuning domain-specific Transformers (e.g., BioBERT for medical texts) may improve performance in specialized fields.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to leverage Transformer models, particularly BERT, for multi-document classification. The solution can be applied to a variety of domains such as news categorization, legal document classification, and healthcare document classification. Fine-tuning pre-trained models offers an efficient way to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex NLP tasks involving multiple documents.
